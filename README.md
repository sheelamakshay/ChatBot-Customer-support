Chatbot Code Overview
This Python code implements a Custom Chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model and Gradio for the user interface. The chatbot can handle user queries and interact with OpenAI’s API to generate responses based on input messages. Additionally, the user is prompted for the type of chatbot they want to create, making this chatbot flexible and customizable for various use cases. Here's a breakdown of the code components:

1. Importing Required Libraries:
python

import openai
import gradio as gr
openai: This is the official Python client library for interacting with OpenAI's API, which is used to send requests to GPT-3.5 and receive responses.
gradio: This is a Python library used to create easy-to-use interfaces for machine learning models, allowing users to interact with the chatbot through a graphical interface.

3. Setting Up the OpenAI API Key:
python

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
Here, you need to replace "your-api-key" with your actual OpenAI API key. This key is necessary to authenticate your requests to OpenAI's servers and interact with their models.
Security Note: Never share your API key publicly, as it provides access to your OpenAI account. If it gets exposed (e.g., in GitHub), it’s important to revoke and regenerate the key immediately.

4. CustomChatGPT Function:
python

def CustomChatGPT(user_input, messages):
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages
    )
    ChatGPT_reply = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": ChatGPT_reply})
    return ChatGPT_reply
Purpose: This function manages the conversation with the GPT-3.5 model.
Parameters:
user_input: The user's message to the chatbot.
messages: A list that contains the conversation history (both user inputs and assistant responses).
Flow:
Append the user's input to the messages list.
Send a request to the OpenAI API with the updated messages.
Retrieve the assistant's response from the API.
Append the assistant's reply to the messages list.
Return the assistant's reply, which is displayed in the interface.
This allows the chatbot to maintain context throughout the conversation.

5. Gradio Interface Setup:
python

def gradio_interface():
    system_msg = input("What type of chatbot would you like to create?\n")
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}]
    
    print("Your new assistant is ready!")

    def interface(user_input):
        return CustomChatGPT(user_input, messages)

    demo = gr.Interface(fn=interface, inputs="text", outputs="text", title="Custom Chatbot")
    demo.launch(share=True)
Purpose: This function sets up the Gradio interface for the chatbot.
Flow:
It first prompts the user to enter the type of chatbot they want to create, which is stored as a system_msg in the conversation history.
The messages list is initialized with the system message.
The interface function handles user input and generates responses using the CustomChatGPT function.
A Gradio interface is created with the function interface, which uses a simple text input-output setup.
demo.launch(share=True) starts the Gradio interface, making it publicly accessible via a shareable link.

7. Generate App Ideas with OpenAI API:
python

def generate_app_ideas():
    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Give me 3 ideas for apps I could build with openai apis "}])
    print(completion.choices[0]["message"]["content"])
Purpose: This function asks GPT-3.5 to generate three app ideas that could be built using OpenAI APIs.
Flow:
It sends a message to OpenAI’s API asking for app ideas.
The response is printed, which contains three app ideas that can be useful for inspiration.

8. Main Function to Control the Program Flow:
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    choice = input("Do you want to use the chatbot interface? (y/n): ")
    
    if choice.lower() == 'y':
        gradio_interface()
    else:
        print("Generating app ideas using OpenAI API...")
        generate_app_ideas()
Purpose: This is the main driver function that determines the flow of the program.
Flow:
The program asks the user if they want to use the chatbot interface.
If the user chooses "y", the Gradio chatbot interface is launched.
If the user chooses "n", the program generates and prints 3 app ideas using the OpenAI API.
User Interaction Example:
When you run the program, it will first ask if you want to use the chatbot interface or generate app ideas.
If you choose to use the chatbot interface, it will prompt you to specify the type of chatbot you want to create.
Once you enter the system message, it will launch the Gradio interface where you can chat with the chatbot.
If you select to generate app ideas, it will provide you with three possible ideas that can be implemented using OpenAI's APIs.
Final Notes:
This code provides an interactive way for users to create a custom chatbot, allowing the chatbot to remember the conversation context and generate appropriate responses using GPT-3.5.
The Gradio interface provides a user-friendly web interface for chatting with the model, while the OpenAI API handles the backend generation of responses.
Make sure to secure your API key and avoid hardcoding it in public repositories.
